Dear John,

I would like to write for change in work location from Pune to Delhi, on the same position. My father is facing some serious medical issues 

which needed me to be with them, as i am the only one to take care.

I have enjoyd woking here for past 2 years and gained amazing experiance. I am confident that my experiance and knowledge will be an asset to THE STAF IN Delhi.


I am attaching my resume for your review. It will be very grateful for me if you consider my request.


Thanks and warm Regards,
Akanksha Srivastava
